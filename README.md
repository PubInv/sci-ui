# Sci-UI

Sci-UI is a webcomponents library for scientific applications.

[StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/) is used to "generate small, blazing fast, and 100% standards based Web Components that run in every browser." StencilJS is framework-agnostic to give Sci-UI components maximum flexibility.

Sci-UI aims to be lightweight. It is framework-agnostic and has minimal dependencies. [D3js](https://d3js.org/) is used directly for plotting.

Some services are provided for use with other Public Invention projects and as reference.
